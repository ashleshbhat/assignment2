I had lock'd the door, and given the key to the prisoner;                                   William                    Smith                                                                                         came to the door, and tap'd, and said, open the door; the prisoner said, let any man open it on his peril; the door opened inwards, he shoved against it, the prisoner and his wife clapp'd their hands on the lock to secure it;  Smith said he would have the door open; he, shoving hard, the door flew open immediately; it was burst open by violence: then the prisoner fetched a blow at him; but I saw no weapon, I did not see the wound till about an hour after. Q. Did you hear any words pass between them after the door was open? Turner. I did not, my Lord. Q. Do you know of any former quarrels between them? Turner. I have heard the prisoner forewarn                                   William                    Smith                                                                                         his house; telling him, if he had any thing belonging to him upon the premisses, to take it away, and be gone from his house. Q. Were you a servant there? Turner. I am a lodger there.                     Joseph                   Carpenter                                                                                        . I was at supper with my fellow servants, and the prisoner came in with his wife, and Mr.  Smith the deceased came in with his whip in his hand; the prisoner was in the back room, Mr.  Smith went up to the door, and knock'd with his knuckles; presently the door flew open, and I saw the prisoner come out; I heard a shreek out, my fellow-servant took hold of the prisoner, and I took the knife out of his hand. It was shewed in Court, a long Clasp knife with a sharp point. Mr.  Smith went into the street, and desir'd a Surgeon might be sent for. Q. Was the knife open? Carpenter. It was, my Lord. Q. Was it bloody? Carpenter. There was some blood upon it, I helped the deceased up stairs, and laid him down on the bed. Q. Did you ever hear any quarrelling between them before this? Carpenter. I have heard the deceased abuse the prisoner in his own house, calling him rogue and scoundrel, telling him, he had no business there; saying, he himself was landlord.                     William                   Segwick                                                                                        . I was in the house the time this thing happened; I saw Mr.  Smith come in with his whip in his hand, he came to the door, and, after a little time, the door flew open. The prisoner and the deceased came and rushed forward towards the street; who came first, I cannot tell: I was sitting behind the last witness almost in the dark, I went out and laid hold of the prisoner, while the other witness took a knife out of his hand; in the fright I did not see the knife. I was servant to the prisoner, he is a very honest man, he always appeared as such to me. Husband Messinger. I am a Surgeon; when I was called to the deceased, I found him with his bowels lying out of his body, which was very soon after it happened. It was my judgment that he could not live, and I told all about me so; he lived near three days, in which time I visited him six times; he was sensible during the whole till a little before he died; I never saw him insensible: he did not give me any account how it happen'd. Q. Do you think that wound was the cause of his death? Messinger. I believe it was; but how he receiv'd it, I cannot tell. Prisoner's Defence. I have been turned out of my own house by that man into the street, and abused by him, and have been driven out of my senses.                     Bathsheba                   Chethem                                                                                        . I have seen Mr.  Smith stand at Mr. Bartholomew's door, and forbid him his own house, and shut the door against him, and he, the prisoner, has gone about the street, and cried like a child. It is a public inn the prisoner kept, and he used to let out coaches and chaises.See original I have known him about ten or eleven years; he is a soft, inoffensive man. The deceased once put the prisoner into the Gate-house, and when he came home, he would not let him come into his own house.                     William                   Cherrey                                                                                        . I have known the prisoner ever since he kept the inn                  . It is the Plough inn in Princess-street; it is about nine or ten years. I always looked upon him as an honest, inoffensive man. I never saw the deceased but a few days before he died standing at the door, as though he was master of the house.                     Margaret                   Christian                                                                                        . I lived with the prisoner six years, he is a very honest man. I was present when the accident happen'd; I was not his servant then, I was there for a pint of beer; I was standing upon the stairs, and I heard the prisoner say, let any man open the door upon his peril. Mr.  Smith said, he would do for him presently, he would have a baily there in half an hour's time; he pushed open the door with his hand, the prisoner met him, and fetched a blow at him; but I saw no weapen he had. Q. Did you ever know the prisoner guilty of passion? Christian. No, I never did. I know this  Smith has been a great enemy to him, and has troubled him many times. Q. What do you think might be the reason of his thus using the prisoner? Christian. I believe he was greater with the prisoner's wife than he should be. Q. Have you made any observations of that the time you lived in the house? Christian. I cannot say I have.                     James                   Scott                                                                                        . I live in the neighbourhood, I have known the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years, and always looked upon him as an honest, inoffensive man, a very hard labouring man.                     Hugh                   Bedle                                                                                        . I live within three or four doors of the prisoner; the character of the man appeared extraordinary good, a pains-taking man. It was talked in the neighbourhood Mr.  Smith was too great with his wife; but how far, I cannot say. Hen. Kellsoe. I live near the prisoner, he is a very honest hard working man; I have traded with him, and always found him so. Q. Was he a man of passion? Kellsoe. I never saw or heard he was a passionate man.                                                       Guilty             of man-slaughter.  [Branding. See summary.]

The 20th of September the prisoner came down to Portsmouth, and came on board the Nottingham, she enquired if any there belonged to Dublin, I gave her some gin slip, she pleaded poverty, saying, she had no money to pay for her lodging, I gave her a shilling, and sent her on shore. We agreed to live together. I took lodgings the latter end of October; I gave her money to purchase goods for me; the first thing bought was a bed cost 50 s. an iron grate, 28 s. 6 d. fire-tongs, poker, tea-kettle, warming-pan and stewpan, 12 plates, 4 pewter-dishes, 7 chairs, a table, a large looking-glass, 4 harrateen curtains and 2 blankets. Q. How came you to lose these things? Kelley. On the 20th of March she desired me to go to Deptford to fetch a pig, and we were to get some peas and make it fat; and while I was gone, she got assistance, and carried away all my goods. Q. What name did this woman come to you by? Kelley. She said her name was Kelley, and she was glad to meet with any of the name out of the country.  See originalQ. Did you give her liberty to pawn any of these things? Kelley. No, I never did. I have found some of the goods again in the man's possession she cohabited with last. Prisoner.

Q. Were they taken away by his consent? Furness. I believe they were not. Q. What time were they taken away? Furness. I do not know the time exactly, it was a little before quarter-day; the prisoner then told me, he was gone to Deptford, or Greenwich, I know not which, and she was going to set up a shop.                     Mary                   Macway                                                                                        .

Q. Who paid for those goods? Macway.                                   John                   Kelley                                                                                        . Q. Did they not go for man and wife then? Macway. No, they did not.                     Peter                   Penney                                                                                        . I live with Mrs. Furness. I saw the prisoner and two men moving the goods from my mistress's house; they carried them all away, I know not whereto. Q. Did                                   John                   Kelley                                                                                         and the prisoner then pass for man and wife? Penney. They did not, to my knowledge. Jos. Richman. The prisoner has been at my house several times after the man was robb'd. He had a warrant from Justice Broadhead to search for the goods. He had her taken up, had her before the Justice, and she was to have been committed; she got bail, ran away from her bail, and was taken again at Portsmouth, and brought to town, and lodged in the Round-house. She was taken out from thence to swear a robbery against the prosecutor: which she did; then he was committed. I once heard the prisoner say, she would swear her soul to the Devil but she would be revenged on him. For the prisoner.                     Mary                   Dodd                                                                                        . I lodged with the prisoner and Mr. Kelley. They lived as man and wife together; and I know he has used her very ill.                     Mary                   Macdonald                                                                                        . I know the prisoner to be a hard-working woman, and I have known the prosecutor about eight months; he always acknowledged her as his wife. Cross examined, Q. Did you know the prisoner when she kept company with one  Smith? Macdonald. Yes I did. Q. Do you know of her carrying any goods away? Macdonald. I do not.                     Ann                   Bucanan                                                                                        . The prisoner has used my house about eight months; and so has he: they always went for man and wife.                     Paul                   Bucanan                                                                                        . The first time I saw the prisoner and prosecutor was in Christmas holy-days; they that time seem'd to take a liking to me and my wife; they have din'd together divers times in my house, and seem'd to be agreeable one with another, but I did not know where they lived; they sold fish, and were pretty customers as they pass'd and repass'd: I do not know whether they are man and wife. One night in particular I heard him say, my dear, go home and make the bed, and I'll not be long before I am with you: after bail was given in the woman was released, and Mr. Kelley and she have come to my house three or four times and have eat and drank together. I took upon me once to talk to Mr. Kelley, for charging the prisoner with a robbery and now to be so free with her; speaking broken Irish, h e said he had no intention to prosecute, or any thing of that nature.                     Elizabeth                   Stiles                                                                                        . Mr. Kelley came to me the beginning of last October to invite me to his wedding dinner, to a house the corner of Prince's-street. I went in the evening, and there was a very great supper. Cross examin'd. Q. Was there any entertainment? Stiles. Yes, and dancing too. Q. Did you look upon them to be man and wife then? Stiles. They appeared so to me. A witness. Mrs. Kelley came to bring me a gown to make, and told me it was to be her wedding-gown,See original and both he and she ask'd me to cometo their house on such a day, saying they should be married that day: I went, there was much victuals, and we were very merry and dancing. One morning after this he came to our house, I ask'd how she did; he seem'd much disturb'd, and desir'd me to go and see her, which I did, and found her with black eyes: she told me he gave them to her; they had fish for dinner; he fed her as she lay in the bed, and said he was sorry for what he had done. Q. Had they no words about  Smith then? Witness. There was something said about him.                                                       Acquitted            .

I live at Hoxton; I had been to receive some money at the other end of the town, but it was too late when I set out for home to bring my money with me, so I left it behind me. I set out from Charing-cross about twelve o'clock at night. I made the best of my way home, and coming down  Fleet-street                                                       I met with the two prisoners at the bar with two or three more lads, and two women with them; they wanted to jo in my company going along; the biggest of these two lads picked my pocket of a handkerchief, and on putting my hand in my pocket, he gave it me no more words pass'd between us. I went down the New-market, they follow'd me, and seem'd to be going up ow-hill, so I went Chick-lane way, and stopping to make water at the upper end of the lane I observed a lusty man among them, and the rest were boys: this man came and struck me a blow on the side of my head with his fist, then they all fell upon me: the biggest of these prisoners struck me across the face with a stick, and would have pull'd off my hat and wig; finding them going, I got fast hold of my wig: I told them I had no money and turn'd about and saw my hat in the biggest of the prisoner's hand: the lusty man and the women run down the alley, and these two prisoners run towards Smithfield, and I followed them. I cry'd out, stoy thief! and run after them, and at the corner of Cow-lane the biggest was stop'd by a watchman, and another watchman took the other in Hosier-lane. The two prisoners were brought to me, and I said to the constable I knew them both; he saw what a sad condition they had made me in; they were sent to the Counter directly. Q. Was you sober? Davis. I was, my lord.                     Edward                   Cruce                                                                                        . I am a watchman, I heard him cry stop thief! seeing a boy come running I stop'd him, and when we came to see the prosecutor, he was much bruis'd, having several cuts on his head and forehead.                     Edward                   Phipps                                                                                        . I am a watchman in Hosier-lane, between the hours of one and two the 14th of last month, I heard the cry; stop thief, and heard somebody running up the lane; I put my lanthorn on the ground, and said, if he did not stop I'd knock him down; he said he liv'd on the other side of the water; then I took him back to where I heardSee original the noise, and found the prosecutor in a sad condition: said I, do you know any thing of this lad, I found him running? yes, said he, that is one of those who robbed me, and desir'd I'd not let him go.  Smith's defence. Coming down the New-market, said the prosecutor to the young woman, will you drink any thing? where are you going? saying, you shall go along with me: she run into an entry, and he after her; she run down the alley: said he to a young man follow her and fetch her out; he took him by the collar and they both fell a fighting, and I stood on the other side of the way. Prisoner Lee's Defence. I never saw any of them 'till the watchman took me in Hosier-lane.  Smith said, he was between 13 and 14 Years old, and Lee said he would be 13 next St. Andrew's day.
